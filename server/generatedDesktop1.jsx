```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Card, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Card>
    <Card.Header>Card Header</Card.Header>
    <Card.Img variant="top" src="image-placeholder <- Change image here" />
    <Card.Body>
      <Card.Title>Card Title</Card.Title>
      <Card.Subtitle className="mb-2 text-muted">Sub Title</Card.Subtitle>
      <Card.Text>
        Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.
      </Card.Text>
      <Button variant="primary">Go somewhere</Button>
    </Card.Body>
    <Card.Body>
      <Card.Link href="#">Card link</Card.Link>
      <Card.Link href="#">Another link</Card.Link>
    </Card.Body>
  </Card>
);

export default MyComponent;
```

This is a simplified version of the JSX code. In a real-world scenario, you would probably want to make the image source, button link, and text content dynamic by passing them as props or getting them from your application's state. Also, the image placeholder text should be replaced with the actual image URL.
