```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Card from 'react-bootstrap/Card';
import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Card>
    <Card.Header>Card Header</Card.Header>
    <Card.Img variant="top" src="image-placeholder <- Change image here" />
    <Card.Body>
      <Card.Title>Card Title</Card.Title>
      <Card.Subtitle className="mb-2 text-muted">Sub Title</Card.Subtitle>
      <Card.Text>
        Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.
      </Card.Text>
      <Button variant="primary">Go somewhere</Button>
    </Card.Body>
    <Card.Body>
      <Card.Link href="#">Card link</Card.Link>
      <Card.Link href="#">Another link</Card.Link>
    </Card.Body>
  </Card>
);

export default MyComponent;
```

This JSX code represents the Figma nodes as React-Bootstrap components. The Card component is used to represent the overall card, with Card.Header, Card.Img, Card.Body, Card.Title, Card.Subtitle, Card.Text, Button, and Card.Link components used to represent the corresponding parts of the card. The text for each component is taken from the "characters" field of the corresponding Figma node. The image source for the Card.Img component is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual image source.
